# Reading "Head First Android"

This repository is to contain my work related to the exercises described 
in the Head First Android book.

## Notes

- Use `android:layout_alignX` (X can be `ParentTop`, `ParentRight`, etc.) 
to put view element at position relative to its parent `RelativeLayout`.
    - `layout_alignLeft`, `layout_below` and others to align view 
    element relative to specified view
